# TaskOne Real-Time Web Applications

The goal of this project was to design and implement a simple, social, text-based adventure game (like Zork http://www.web-adventures.org/cgi-bin/webfrotz?s=ZorkDungeon, or Text-based Multiplayer Shooter http://eigen.pri.ee/shooter/ ).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm install`

Will install all the dependencies the project needs to run. 

### `npm run server`

Runs the NodeJS server 
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) which serves at a backend to my front end react application


### `npm client`

Runs the client (the React application)
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the client and the server (this is the script you need to run if you want to see the game works).

## Notes

Since all the highscore data is stored in the bestscores.json file, it not necessary to deploy the application (it won't work if it deployed). I will deploy it for Task2.
